# Moodle-Stripe
Simple and easy plugin for moodle to use stripe checkout


Based on the builtin PayPal plugin, and Stripe hosted Checkout form. 

Configuration is almost selfexplainatory. 

For details regarding individual configuration options see the PayPal plugin documentation (expect for the Stripe API Key, which is of course the Stripe API Key - use the test key for test and live key for production)
